#### Warning!
You need to be abit familiar with HTML and CSS. 

In manage ranks, assign a css class that you define to your ranks. 
Then, all post-container classes for will be appended with the assigned css class for the rank of the user that posted. 
As an example, the pbWoW style contains 2 content styling classes : "blizz" and "mvp". 
You would then need to assign these classes to your ranks. 
 ```
 .blizz .content { color: #00C0FF; }
 .blizz .content strong { color: #FFF; }
 .mvp .content { color: #5DF644; }
 .mvp .content strong { color: #FFF; }
```

No support will be given beyond the actual functionality of the extension. All styling is up to you.
